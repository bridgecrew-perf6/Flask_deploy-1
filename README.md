# Flask Deploy
The following is a Shell script to deploy and publish a Flask into a Docker container.

The following is an experimental and functional, in my case, Shell script to deploy and publish a Flask app in a remote server using a Docker container. Sure now at days, you have so many tools that can help you with your pipelines that you would ask "why bother?"; however, I needed to create something simple and quick and that I could modify on the fly.

In addition, you can also import your public ssh key to the server and you will not have to deal with entering the password.
However, you could modify the script and have the container be setup in your local computer instead of a remote server.
